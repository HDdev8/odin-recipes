      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        These muffins are incredible. You won't be able to resist their
        fluffiness or their gooey blueberries in every bite.
      </p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>½ cup softened butter</li>
        <li>1¼ cups sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>2 cups blueberries, washed, drained and picked over</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons sugar</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375.</li>
        <li>Cream the butter and 1¼ cups sugar until light.</li>
        <li>
          Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add
          vanilla.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder, and add to the
          creamed mixture alternately with the milk.
        </li>
        <li>
          Crush ½ cup blueberries with a fork, and mix into the batter. Fold in
          the remaining whole berries.
        </li>
        <li>
          Line a 12 cup standard muffin tin with cupcake liners, and fill with
          batter. Sprinkle the 3 teaspoons sugar over the tops of the muffins,
          and bake at 375 degrees for about 30-35 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove muffins from tin and cool at least 30 minutes. Store,
          uncovered, or the muffins will be too moist the second day, if they
          last that long.
